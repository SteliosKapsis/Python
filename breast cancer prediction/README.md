This is a python project where you take a data set and check for high correlation between the different characteristics of a tumor (benign , malignant). After dealing 
with this problem, you can train your model to predict fairly accurately (considering many characteristics of a tumor) whether it is malignant or benign using different 
algorithms like Logistic Regression , Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM(Support Vector Machine) , KNN(k-nearest neighbors) and NB(Naive Bayes). 
P.S.The plots are uploaded as .PNG files.
